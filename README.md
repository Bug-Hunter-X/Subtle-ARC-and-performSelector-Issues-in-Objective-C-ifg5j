This repository demonstrates two uncommon yet significant errors in Objective-C programming. The first involves a subtle memory management issue related to ARC. The second showcases the potential pitfalls of using `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` without careful consideration of object lifetimes.  Both examples include detailed explanations and solutions to avoid these problems. The code is designed to be easily understandable and replicable, facilitating learning and preventing similar errors in your own projects.
