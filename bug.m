In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@property (strong, nonatomic) MyObject *myObject;

- (void)someMethod {
    MyObject *tempObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    self.myObject = tempObject;
    // ... some operations using myObject ...
}
```

The issue: While `self.myObject = tempObject;` assigns ownership to the property, the `tempObject` variable itself still retains a strong reference to the object.  If this method returns, ARC will release `tempObject` *first*, resulting in an object deallocated before the `myObject` property's strong reference is the only one remaining. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior later.

Another, rarer error involves improper use of `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:`.  If the selector targets an object that's been deallocated before the delay elapses, a crash is inevitable.  Furthermore, if the selector invocation relies on a non-retained object passed as an argument, the argument may be deallocated before the selector is invoked, leading to unexpected results or crashes.
